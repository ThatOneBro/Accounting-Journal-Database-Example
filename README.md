# Accounting-Journal-Database-Example

This project is an example of a web-based accounting journal entry client with a Node.js/Express and MySQL backend.

If you are unfamiliar with the way accounting journal entries work, here is a guide to making a journal entry:

1. Select a date on or before today.
2. Add at least one other row to the form. **You need at least one debit and one credit account.**
3. Flag the second account as credit. *Ex. Debit: Accounts Payable; Credit: Cash*
4. Ensure that the **sum of all debit amounts equals the sum of all credit amounts.**

That's all it takes. If you have any questions feel free to contact me at <mailto:derrick.c.farris@gmail.com>.
